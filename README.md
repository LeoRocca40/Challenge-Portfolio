# Challenge Portfolio ReadMe
Personal portfolio for second challenge of the bootcamp.

## Description
This website was designed for myself so I could have my own website to show my portfolio to anybody that wants to see it. It contains HTML and CSS. 

## Instalation
N/A

## Usage
- First, load up the website.
- From there, you can scroll from the top to the bottom freely.
- To use the Navbar in the top right corner of the website, hover over each button and click where you would like to go. At the very bottom of the website, if you click on "Leonardo Roccaforte," you will be brought back to the top of the website.
- At the bottom of the website, you will see four cards. Each card contains an image and a button. Clicking on a button on any of the four cards will open another website in a new tab. 

## Features
- Navbar in header with four buttons to take you around the website.
- Button in footer to take you back to the top of the website.
- Cards that open a link in a new tab.
